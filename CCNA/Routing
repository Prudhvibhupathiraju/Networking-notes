it is the process that the routers use to determine that the IP packets should take over the network to reach their destination

A route is a instruction to a router that to send the packet to destination X it should send the packet to next hop(next router in the path to destination) Y
or if the destination is directly connected to the router then send the packet directly to the destination
or if the destination is the router itself then recieve the packet don't forward it
